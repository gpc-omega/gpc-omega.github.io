Hello, everyone! This is the first post for our blog and our brand new
site. We've added a couple of nice things:

1. You can always look up the room number and date we're meeting at
   for the club meeting.
2. Updates on guest speakers will now be posted here
3. We're adding a list of free resources for development for your
   perousal.

In the near future, we want to add in embedding Google Calendar and a
few more nice things to make our site feel a little more cozy and
functional.

Don't feel shy about writing posts about the progress on your own
projects here! Or if you've found some cool technology you enjoy
working with. Just clone the repo, start up Jekyll with drafts enabled
and start writing!
